# Create Vite PWA

This is an enhancement to the [create Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) package (`npm init vite@latest`) that enhances any of the available Vite starters to make them work as a PWA through [Vite Plugin PWA](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/) and [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox). Out of the box, you get the following:

- The Vite starter of your choice
- Vite Plugin PWA configured with a basic Web App Manifest
- Service Worker registration through Vite Plugin PWA
- Sample icons to use
- A Service Worker with a basic offline fallback provided by [Workbox Recipes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-recipes#offline_fallback)

## Usage

Run `npm init create-vite-pwa`.
